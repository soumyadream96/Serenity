## What is this ?

Serenity is a audio player which focuses on play Music Meditation and Podcasts. It let's you stream songs from various sources including Local and Online storage devices

## Pre-alpha release

The current version is a pre-alpha early access. Some of it is usable, some of it isn't. If there are things that don't work as expected or are counterintuitive, please open an issue so I can prioritize working on them.

- Manage songs queue
- Radio mode (automatically queue similar tracks)
- Searching for and playing music from YouTube (including integration with YouTube playlists)

## Planned features

- Play and download songs from Google Drive
- Newest releases - tracks and albums
- Creating a backup on Google Drive and sync audio from it üé∂
- Searching for related songs in YouTube
- Multiple language support
- Real time lyrics
- Support for web (React Native Web) and Desktop (React Native Windows and MacOS)
- Searching for and playing music from bandcamp (including albums), and soundcloud
- Searching for albums (powered by last.fm and musicbrainz), album view, automatic song lookup based on artist and track name (in progress, can be dodgy sometimes)
- Newest releases with reviews - tracks and albums
- Browsing by popularity
- Country-specific top lists
- Listening suggestions (similar artists, albums, tracks)

## Development Process

Serenity is open to contributions, but I recommend creating an issue or replying in a comment to let me know what you are working on first that way we don't overwrite each other.
