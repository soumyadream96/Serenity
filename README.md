# Serenity
## A React Native Application

A mobile music player focused on streaming from free sources. Built with Rich UI

## What is this?
Serenity is still trying it figure out it's purpose. For sure it wants to the best in what ever it wants to be. 



## Aspects Involved

### Music 
- In the words of Plato
	> Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination and life to everything. 

- In the words of Billy Joel
	> I think music in itself is healing. It’s an explosive expression of humanity. It’s something we are all touched by. No matter what culture we’re from, everyone loves music. 
	
- In the words of Albert Schweitzer
	> There are two means of refuge from the miseries of life: music and cats.

### Artificial Intelligence
- Mechine learning for Facial recognition

### Awesome UI
- > Beauty ain't always a little, cute colored flower. Beauty is anything where people be like, 'Damn.'
- In the words of Yajana  
    > When I admire the wonders of an Application or the beauty of the UI, my soul expands in the worship of the creator

The current version is a pre-alpha early access. Some of it is usable, some of it isn't. If there are things that don't work as expected or are counterintuitive, please open an issue so I can prioritize working on them.
